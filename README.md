# TR Project

## Overview
**TR** is a comprehensive school management web application built with **Django**. It provides a digital platform for managing the academic lifecycle, including student enrollment, course management, grading, and attendance tracking. The system is designed to serve multiple user roles: Administrators, Professors, Tutors (Parents), and Students.

## Technology Stack
-   **Backend Framework**: Python / Django 5.2
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (running in Docker)
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla + jQuery)
-   **Containerization**: Docker / Podman
-   **Environment Management**: `venv` (Python Virtual Environment)

## Key Features

### 👥 User Roles & Permissions
-   **Administrators**: Full control over the system. Can create school years, define course structures, and manage users.
-   **Professors**: Access to assigned classes. Can grade students, record absences, and download/upload class data.
-   **Tutors (Parents)**: View-only access to their children's academic records (grades, absences).
-   **Students**: Personal dashboard to view their own grades and attendance history.

### 🏫 Academic Management
-   **School Years & Trimesters**: Flexible system to define academic years (e.g., "2025-2026") and their associated trimesters.
-   **Course Structure**: Support for different educational levels (ESO, Bachillerato, IB) and sections (e.g., "1A", "2B").
-   **Cascading Logic**: Smart forms that filter levels and sections dynamically based on the selected course type.

### 📊 Grading & Attendance
-   **Gradebook**: Record grades for exams, partials, and finals.
-   **Attendance Tracking**: Log absences and delays with timestamps.
-   **Data Export/Import**:
    -   Download class lists and grade templates as CSV.
    -   Bulk import grades via CSV upload.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **Podman** (for running the database)
*   **Tmux** (optional, for using the `run.sh` script)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd TR
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

You can run the application using the provided script or manually.

#### Option 1: Using `run.sh` (Recommended)

This script manages the database container and the Django server in a `tmux` session.

```bash
./run.sh
```

*   **What it does:**
    1.  Starts the PostgreSQL database using `podman-compose`.
    2.  Starts the Django development server.
    3.  Attaches to a `tmux` session where you can see both logs.
*   **To detach:** Press `Ctrl+b` then `d`.
*   **To stop:** Kill the tmux session or press `Ctrl+c` in the panes.

#### Option 2: Manual Start

1.  **Start the Database:**
    Ensure you have Podman installed.
    ```bash
    podman-compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Run Migrations (First time only):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3.  **Create Superuser (First time only):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

4.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

2.  **Access the Admin Panel**:
    -   URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`
    -   Use the superuser credentials to log in (default: `admin` / `admin` - *check `compose.yaml` for DB creds, Django admin user may need creation*).

## Development Notes
-   **AJAX**: The application uses jQuery for dynamic form interactions (e.g., selecting a course type loads the available levels).
-   **Security**: Ensure `DEBUG` is set to `False` and `SECRET_KEY` is secured before deploying to a production environment.
